Just another Hello-World repository


Hello everybody,

this is another readme about hello-world.

The use of the text "Hello World!" Is a tradition and goes back to Programming in C - A Tutorial [1], an internal programming manual of Bell Laboratories using the C programming language written by Brian Kernighan in 1974, having been there a year earlier used the words "hello" and "world" in an introduction to the B programming language. [2] However, the text only gained notoriety through the publication in 1978 in the book The C Programming Language (German programming in C) by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie. [3]

Even though the notation hello, world (without capital letters and exclamation points) was used in both publications, Hello World! enforced.
